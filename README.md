# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Results
The purpose of the MechaCar analysis was to determine if there was a relationship between fuel-efficiency (mpg) and any of the other factors related to the cars (length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and all wheel drive).  After performing linear regression on the data supplied it can be concluded as follows:

1) Vehicle Length: With a p-value of 2.60e-12, the null hypothesis must fail to be rejected (failed to prove vehicle length has a correlation to fuel-efficiency).
2) Vehicle Weight: With a p-value of 0.0776, the null hypothesis is rejected (there appears to be a correlation between vehicle weight and fuel-efficiency).
3) Spoiler Angle: With a p-value of 0.3069, the null hypothesis is rejected (there appears to be a correlation between spoiler angle and fuel-efficiency).
4) Ground Clearance: With a p-value of 5.21e-08, the null hypothesis must fail to be rejected (failed to prove ground clearance has a correlation to fuel-efficiency).
5) AWD: With a p-value of 0.1852, the null hypothesis is rejected (there appears to be a correlation between AWD and fuel-efficiency).

### Slope
The slope of the linear regression analysis was 0.71 which indicates a strong correlation between the variables and fuel-efficiency. 

### Conclusion
This linear model can be used to predict mpg for MechaCar prototypes based on weight, spoiler angle, and AWD.


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
After analyzing if the PSI for the different manufacturing lots were statictically different, here are the results:
* PSI across all manufacturing lots is not statistically differentn from the population mean (p = 1)
* PSI
