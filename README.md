# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Results
The purpose of the MechaCar analysis was to determine if there was a relationship between fuel-efficiency (mpg) and any of the other factors related to the cars (length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and all wheel drive).  After performing linear regression on the data supplied it can be concluded as follows:

* Vehicle Length: With a p-value of 2.60e-12, the null hypothesis is rejected (there is a statistically significant relationship between vehicle length and fuel-efficiency).
* Vehicle Weight: With a p-value of 0.0776, the null hypothesis must fail to be rejected (there isn't a statistically significant relationship between vehicle weight and fuel-efficiency).
* Spoiler Angle: With a p-value of 0.3069, the null hypothesis must fail to be rejected (there isn't a statistically significant relationship between spoiler angle and fuel-efficiency).
* Ground Clearance: With a p-value of 5.21e-08, the null hypothesis is rejected (there is a statistically significant relationship between ground clearance  and fuel-efficiency).
* AWD: With a p-value of 0.1852, the null hypothesis must fail to be rejected (there isn't a statistically significant relationship between AWD and fuel-efficiency).

### Slope
The slope of the linear regression analysis was 0.71 which indicates a strong correlation between the variables and fuel-efficiency. 

### Conclusion
This linear model can be used to predict mpg for MechaCar prototypes based on vehicle length and ground clearance.


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
After analyzing the PSI for the different manufacturing lots I have concluded that there is no statistical difference across any of the manufacturing lots.  The p-value for each of the individual lots (1-3), compared to the overall mean was 1.
